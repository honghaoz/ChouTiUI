  /// The total number of crossed path lines (including implicit path lines) and the direction of each path line are then interpreted as follows:
  ///
  /// - For the even-odd rule, if the total number of path crossings is odd, the point is considered to be inside the path and the corresponding region is filled.
  ///   If the number of crossings is even, the point is considered to be outside the path and the region is not filled.
  ///
  /// - For the non-zero rule, the crossing of a left-to-right path counts as +1 and the crossing of a right-to-left path counts as -1.
  ///   If the sum of the crossings is nonzero, the point is considered to be inside the path and the corresponding region is filled.
  ///   If the sum is 0, the point is outside the path and the region is not filled.
